## About
 Once upon a time, there was a lonely werewolf with wings of a falcon named Soven. He was cursed since birth due to a deal made by his mother with a witch to obtain money. Little did she know that the curse would befall her child. Soven lived alone in the forest, until one day, a princess wandering in the forest offered him food, which became his only human contact.
